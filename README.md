# Magic Mic

Record, transcribe, and summarize audio directly into
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with custom assistants.

## Features

### ‚≠êÔ∏è Run custom summary assistants

Summary assistants turn your transcribed memos into useful notes. Set up one
assistant for journal entries and another for meeting notes - it's completely up
to you!

### üìÉ Transcribe with spelling and style hints

Seed Magic Mic with a sample of names and acronyms to prevent annoying
misspellings. Be sure to read [OpenAI's docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text/prompting) to get the most out of this feature.

### üî¥ Record as long as you like

Magic Mic handles long running audio gracefully and intelligently following
OpenAI's best practices.

### üéß Transcribe and summarize outside audio

Use your summary assistants on audio that wasn't recorded within Obsidian.
Just add the audio to your vault, open it, and run the 'Transcribe and summarize' command with one of your assistants.

## Getting started

Configure an OpenAI API key in the Magic Mic settings. You can get one from
https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

Then, click the Magic Mic icon (the microphone) to begin recording. Click the
icon again to pause or finish recording. A new note will be created with the
audio file, a transcript, and summary generated by your chosen assistant. The
note and audio file are stored in the vault according to your Obsidian settings.

Now that you've gotten the hang of it, try controlling Magic Mic via commands!
You can start, pause, resume, cancel, or finish recording.
